How To Run the Program:
Go into the terminal, and then go into the goPaymentReport directory. Type supervisor app.js to start the program.

If you need to change the csv or the month you're sending reports out on, edit the file found in public/MASTER_CONTROLS.json. Then go into terminal and run python crunchData.py. It should take 30 s - 1m for the python program to run.
